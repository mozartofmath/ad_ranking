# Ad Scoring
This repo contains a jupyter notebook with a function that scores ads based on engagement. Using this function, 
we have implemented a heroku app where you can enter the campaign id and then download a csv file containing 
the scoring of ads with that campaign id.

# Code
We have deployed this app on heroku. The link is https://rank-ads.herokuapp.com/
